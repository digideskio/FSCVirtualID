The FSC Virtual ID app is a prototype app exclusively designed for Farmingdale State College that can be a replacement
for a Student ID card. The method was to use a QR code scanner to buy goods or to access dormitories/gym/facilities.
The idea was to allow students or staffs to add funds, view balance, view transaction history of recent purchases,
view contacts/hours. It includes a pin-unlock screen prior to viewing the QR code. It makes it more secure than using
a Student ID card. Student ID cards can be lost, stolen or forgotten. The Virtual ID app is always available as long
as you have your smartphone.
